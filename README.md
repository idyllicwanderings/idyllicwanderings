 ### Cecilia (She/her/hers)
 Earthbound, yet avid apprentice in security engineering & cryptography, especially in zero-knowledge proofs. Exploring sophisticated fun in English literature, indie rock music, befriending pigeons, making puns, and wandering on random streets. Currently interested in software optimization/implementation of crypto compilers.

 I speak Chinese, English, ein bisschen Deutsch. C/C++, JAVA, python, and Rust are also the languages I "speak".
